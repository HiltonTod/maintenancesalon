								<h3>PRICING IS BASED ON STYLISTS AND INDIVIDUAL CONSULTATION</h3>
								<h3>Level System:</h3>
								<p>Our prices are a range based on our level system, which reflects the stylists experience, expertise and demand.</p>
								<p>Aspiring stylists begin their careers in a rigorous training program as an associate working hand-in-hand with their trainer as a team. Upon graduating from an associate & taking the floor as a new stylist, they launch their career as a Level 3 Stylist. From there on, as the stylist improves their craft & builds their clientele, their demand of time increases & they move to the next level. Pricing for each level is available when booking over the phone, in-salon, or upon consultation.</p>
								<p>Our level system allows clients to get their ideal look while staying within their beauty budget. If you are looking for more affordable pricing, you can elect to receive great service from one of our Level 1-3 stylists. If you desire a premium service from a very experienced stylist, look to book your services with a Level 4-8 stylist.</p>
								<h3>Ala Carte:</h3>
								<p>We recognize that every individual is unique, so all of our services include a pre service consultation. Your stylist will customize the service specifically for your lifestyle, hair texture, and desires. All services are a starting point for average length and texture of hair.  Additional time or product may be required for your specific texture, length or density of hair.</p>
								<p>Quote before we create: We do everything ala carte and strive to provide you a look within your beauty budget.  Our goal is to be upfront with no surprises with what you will pay.  Your stylist will work with you to customize the treatment plan for your hair and desired look before the appointment begins. Please bring photos and ideas to your appointments, along with your beauty budget.</p>
